## Common Questions

### Q: Can I cancel a request after sending it?
**A:** Yes! Go to the "Outgoing" tab and click "🚫 Cancel Request" on any pending request.

### Q: Can I change the scheduled time after accepting?
**A:** Currently, you would need to coordinate directly via email with the other person.

### Q: What if someone doesn't show up for the scheduled call?
**A:** You can reach out via email. If they continue to be unavailable, you don't need to mark it as completed.

### Q: Are the actual calls handled by this platform?
**A:** No, this platform only manages the request/scheduling process. You'll use your own preferred video/audio platform (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) for the actual call.

### Q: Can others see my call summaries?
**A:** No, only the two participants (requester and answerer) can see the call summary.

### Q: Why do answers need 3+ upvotes?
**A:** This ensures you're connecting with people who have provided valuable, quality answers that the community has validated.

### Q: Can I request multiple calls with the same person?
**A:** Yes! You can send a new request after the previous one is completed, rejected, or cancelled.

### Q: What happens if I mark a call as complete but the other person doesn't?
**A:** That's fine! Either party can mark it as complete. Once one person adds a summary, both can see it.
